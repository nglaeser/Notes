### Vim Magic

#### Some vim commands
Except where otherwise noted, these are all to be executed in command mode:  
- `f[char]`: advance to the next occurence of [char] in this line  
- `ctrl+a`: increment the next number in this line by 1
- `:setmouse=a`: activate mouse in vim
- `ctrl+v`: visual **BLOCK** mode
- `a(` in visual mode: everything inside the parentheses (or `{`, `[`, `<`)
- `read [command]` or `read [filename]`: paste output of command or file on next line
- `![CLI command]`: execute CLI command (for example, `:read !date` pastes the current date and time on the next line)
- `%s/foo/bar/gc`: substitute (`s`) all occurrences in a line (`g`) in the full file (`%`) of `foo` with `bar`, asking for confirmation (`c`)
- `gq[motion]`: reformat text to be 80 columns wide

#### Plugins
- [nerdtree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree): tree explorer plugin

#### Macros
- In command mode, type `qa` (`q` to record macro, `a` (or `b`, etc.) specifies the macro register).
- Perform your motions, which will be recorded in the macro
- Type q to finish the macro

Example:
```
int foo(int x) {
    # some code
}
```
Making a macro that will insert a comment at the end of a function with the function name and type:
```
f[space]        # find the next occurenct of a space in the line (i.e. before function name)
yf)             # yank up to the next occurence of )
f{              # find the next occurence of {
%               # go to the corresponding close of expression (i.e. the corresponding })
Shift A + //    # write a comment at the end of the line
p               # paste the yanked expression from earlier (in this case, "foo(int x)")
```

To execute a macro, type, for instance,
```
3@a     # repeat the macro in register "a" 3 times
```
