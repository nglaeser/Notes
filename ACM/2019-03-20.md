# Awk

- Aho (of compilers), Kernighan (of UNIX), Weinberger
- Record-oriented programming
    - every row is a **record**, every column in the record is a **field**

## Why Awk?

- Widely available (required by POSIX 2008)
    - UNIX standard
- easy
    - modern conveniences like dynamic typing, automatic memory allocation
    - heavily optimized for common-case
- faster
- concise
- rapid development

## Workflow

- Read input from stream
- Separate along delimiter into _records_
- Separate records into _fields_ (with a different delimiter)
- do stuff
- output more records (maybe in a different format)

Fundamentals:  
- an Awk program is a list of patterns and actions
    - also BEGIN and END
- default action is "print everything"
- Main variables:
    - RS - input record separator (by default `\n`)
    - FS - input field separator (by default a space - tab in OG Awk, `\s*` in gawk)
    - ORS - output record separator
    - OFS  - output field separator

## Examples

```
printf "1\n2\n10\n30\n5\n14\n7"

# now we want to find only the numbers that are greater than 10

printf "1\n2\n10\n30\n5\n14\n7" | awk '$1 >= 10'
# pattern: $1 is the first field of every record (line)
# uses default action (print)
# so only matches pattern if the field is greater than 10,
# and then takes the default action
```

Deleting:  

```
$ printf "a,b,c\n1,2,3,4\nx,y,z"
    a,b,c
    1,2,3,4
    x,y,z

# delete rows that don't have exactly 3 fields
$ printf "a,b,c\n1,2,3,4\nx,y,z" | awk -F, 'NF==3'
    a,b,c
    x,y,z
```

`-F,` sets the field separator to comma.

```
Smith,John
Aho,Alfred
Kernighan,Brian
Smith,Jane


$ printf ... | awk -F, '$1 == "Smith" {print($2)}'
    John
    Jane
```

Equivalently:  

```
awk -F, '$1 ~ /Smith/ {print($2)}'
awk 'BEGIN {FS=","} $1 ~ /Smith/ {print($2)}'
awk 'BEGIN {FS=","} $1 == "Smith" {print($2)}'
```

`~` is an "if regex matches" operator, and the regex is wrapped in slashes.

Table processing: sum a column.

```
$ printf "A,1\nB,2\nC,3\nD,4\nE,3"
    A,1
    B,2
    C,3
    D,4
    E,3

# sum column 2; semicolon is optional
# variable that hasn't been defined yet is set to 0 (aka sum is 0 to start)
$ printf "A,1\nB,2\nC,3\nD,4\nE,3" | awk -F, '{sum+=$2} END {print(sum);}'
```

Table processing: sum by key.

```
$ printf "A,1\nB,2\nA,3\nC,4\nB,3"
    A,1
    B,2
    A,3
    C,4
    B,3

# sum by key
# do the END command at the end
$ printf "A,1\nB,2\nC,3\nD,4\nE,3" | awk -F, '{sum[$1]+=$2} END {for (key in sum) {printf("%s: %s\n", key, sum[key])}}'
    A: 4
    B: 5
    C: 4
```

Example from robotics class (`qupdate.awk`). I will not be reproducing this here, can be found at 

```
BEGIN {
    row = 0;
}

{
    # read in data
}

END {
    # do the algorithm
    # and output
}
```

Execute with  
```
awk -f qupdate.awk < input1.txt
```

## Examples from Book

### A Language for Drawing Graphs (Section 6.2)

Data:  
```
label Annual Traffic Deaths USA 1899-2017 (Wikipedia)
range 0 1899 2017 60000     # xmin ymin xmax ymax
left ticks ...              # locations of ticks for x-axis
bottom ticks ...            # locations of ticks for x-axis
```

```
awk -f graph.awk < data.txt
```

Will produce-ASCII only graph.  

In `graph.awk`, we see that we can define functions:
```
function xscale(x) {
    return int((x-xmin)/(xmax-xmin) * (wid-1-ox) + 0x + 0.5)
}
```

### An Infix Calculator (Section 6.5)

```
$ printf "(1+2)\*7+5" | awk -f calc3.awk
    26
```

This utilizes a formal grammar; described in detail in the book.  

### Make: A file Updating Program (Section 7.4)

A simple version of `make` written in Awk (52 lines).  

```
$ awk -f make.awk demo.bin
    cc linked_list .c -c
    cc dmo.c -c
    cc linked_list.o demo.o -o demo.bin
```
