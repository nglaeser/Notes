## Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)

Notes from the University of South Carolina ACM chapter meetings.  
- **5-Sep-2018:** Introductory talk on how to succeed in college/CS/life
- **3-Oct-2018:** Tips and tricks for using the text editor `vim`
- **24-Oct-2018:** Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

## Cybersecurity

Notes from University of South Carolina [Cybersecurity Club](http://www.usccyber.org) meetings and cybersecurity-related conferences/competitions.  

### USC Cybersecurity Club
- **16-Nov-2018:** Introduction to Containers, including a container-hacking demo

### PCDC/SECCDC
- **26-Nov-2018:** Training notes for Palmetto Cyber Defense Competition (PCDC)/Southeast Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (SECCDC),
including competition layout and resources

### BSides Charleston 2017
These are found in the folder [BSides-Charleston](Cybersecurity/BSides-Charleston) (no year). The notes are from the Security BSides conference in Charleston, SC on November 10-11, 2017. In this case I will eschew the date-filename convention I have been following because the dates are not as informative.  
- 10-Nov-2017: **Python+WiFi** workshop held by stryngs on hacking WiFi with Python commands, packages, and scripts
- 11-Nov-2017: **Keynote** speech by Jack Daniel on cybersecurity then and now
- 11-Nov-2017: **Learning to Firewalk** by Brian Austin, a talk about how to get into cybersecurity (a long, useful list of resources)
- 11-Nov-2017: **Cryptography Challenge** in the BSides CTF, run by [@lintile](https://twitter.com/lintile). Our team (consisting of James Coman and myself) won the challenge, contributing a significant portion of CTF points to our university team and putting us in 3rd place in the full CTF. These notes are very ad hoc as they were written in a rush during the challenge; a more polished walkthrough is presented in our talk to the USC Cybersecurity club ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qebj1XR-cpxRaIZtb6xdViS8auePCj1k0spnPpfJJ6w/edit?usp=sharing)).

### BSides Charleston 2018
Notes from Security BSides in Charleston, SC on November 9-10, 2018. Same thing about date names.  
- 9-Nov-2018: **Container Hacking** workshop by Cory Sebol
- 10-Nov-2018: **Keynote speech #1** by Vitali Kremez on the evolution of cybercrime

## Grace Hopper Celebration (GHC) 2017

Notes from the 2017 Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing held in Orlando, FL on October 4-6, 2017. Again, ditto about the filenames.  
- 4-Oct-2017: **Finding your Dream Job with a Ph.D.** - process, expectations, and pros and cons of various career paths for Ph.D.s
- 4-Oct-2017: **Graduate School Survival Skills**
- 5-Oct-2017: **Why and How to Prepare for Hackathons**

## µ611

My friends James Coman, William Edwards, Brady O'Leary, and I gathered at my friend Charles Daniel's house for a couple of days after final exams to work through the curriculum of South Carolina's Advanced Digital Design course (CSCE 611); we called it "micro-611". We tried to complete six projects on FPGAs, leading up to the construction of a fully functional MIPS processor. I was only able to stay for three days, so the remainder of these notes will be added in the spring when I finish going over the material with Charles (he's got the FPGAs, after all).  
- **15-Dec-2018:** Background on FPGAs and Verilog
- **16-Dec-2018:** ALU design (project 2) and introducing the regfile (project 3)
- **17-Dec-2018:** MIPS command overview; CPU to be implemented in projects 4-6
