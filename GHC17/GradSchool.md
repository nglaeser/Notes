### Overview
Research is unstructured. In graduate school, you will be forced to multitask with teaching, personal life, etc. Having good time management will ensure you don't turn into a workaholic. What follow are some strategies for being successful in graduate school.

### General Strategies
- Find your "best time" of day to be productive
- Find your best work style
- Pick a day of the week dedicated to RESEARCH ONLY
- Schedule time off
- Reward yourself for *input*, not output
- Take 15 minutes at the beginning of the day: what do you need to do today?
- At the end of the week: take some time to reflect, and take notes!
  - What have you done this week?
  - What do you need to do next week?

### Research Structure
- Keep an online research notebook, shared with your advisor. Include progress, ideas, questions, future ideas, review
- Have a big picture written at the top
- To begin your notebook: write the abstract as it would be if everything goes perfectly
  - Remember, abstracts end with the bigger picture/meaning of the research
- Break the project down into components
- For all papers you read, take notes: gaps, questions, next steps

### Advisor Meetings
- Give your advisor a brief blurb of your research at each meeting
- Come in with specific questions
- 24 hours in advance, send links to readings for context
- Give context: short-term and big picture
- Take notes of action items for the week, then repeat to advisor before you leave

### Saying "Yes" or "No"
- Choose carefully!
- "Can I think about it and get back to you? (take at least 1 day to think)
- Does it fit your goals?
- Negotiate: If I do X, I can't do Y/will have to delay Y
- Say yes to the item, not the person – don't do anything out of guilt

### Use your Advisor as a Mentor
- Discuss your strengths and weaknesses
- Talk about long-term goals and strategies
- Ask for info/resources, nomination for awards, conferences, workshops
- Go through specific training with your mentor:
  - elevator pitch
  - reviews
