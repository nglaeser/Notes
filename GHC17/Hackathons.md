### Background
- Due to time constraints, hackathons generally only produce proof of concept solutions 
- Judged by professionals, entrepreneurs, startups

### Judging Factors
- \*Scalability/feasibility (this matters in enterprise)
- User experience (for web/app development)
- Final pitch (be sure to leave time to prep, and make it creative and memorable)
  - Present the big (hypothetical) solution first
  - Then present your specific part so far (the use case)

### Setting Up and Running a Hackathon
- Use resources from local incubators
- Pick good mentors to cover all categories (development, project management, business, finance)
- Get investors to act as judges
- Publish success stories
- Encourage teams to take their apps/projects to the next level
  - go public
  - contact investors
  - provide them with resources
- Form categories
  - By API experience
  - By type (Data Science, AI, VR, etc.)
A previous successful example: Refugee apps hackathon

### How to Prepare for a Hackathon
- Work with APIs you already know (so, learn APIs in your downtime!)
- Go over past hackathons (look at their sample APIs) & presentations
- Brainstorm project ideas
- Form a team
