#### Advice
##### Network
- Volunteer at conferences & local events
- Attend talks & meet the presenters afterwards
- Present at conferences
- Alumni network
- When applying to jobs after a Ph.D., be sure you are considered as an **industry hire** and not through college recruiting (there are various types of recruiters in a company)

##### Phone Interviews
- Look up the contact person
- Look up the group/team
- Look up the position

##### On-Site Interviews
- Give yourself time – get in the day before
- Be early
- Dress appropriately (even if you are more dressed up than the employees)
- Be confident
- Know the format: are you giving a talk? Whiteboard? Meetings?
  - Ask for list of people beforehand (and look them up)
  - Ask for breaks if needed/go to bathroom
  - Lunch/dinner are still interviews
- Can you see yourself there?
- Have an elevator pitch

##### The Offer
Negotiate!
- Starting date
- Salary (starting salary is important!!)
  - If they ask how much money you want, you can say "I'm happy to consider your best offer"
- Signing bonus
- Moving package
- Campus, flexibility
- Space

**Note: With a Ph.D., make sure coding skills are visible on your résumé and up-to-date**

## Academia

#### Post-Docs
- Transition to another career path (teaching or research)
- Money from fellowships, university/department, professional research grants
- Post-docs may be posted, or you will need to use your network to find one
- Though less common, you can also remain in your Ph.D. lab
- During your post-doc, begin being involved in professional orgs, organizing conferences, and editing/reviewing for journals

#### Switching from an Industry Lab to Academia
- Switch early if you want to follow a normal tenure track
- If not, you'll pretty much have to get famous first in order to receive direct tenure

#### Academia Tracks
- **Research**: Emphasis on discovery; have both grad and undergrad assistance; need to find funding
- **Teaching**: Teach, mentor, advise
- **Service**: Chair/serve on committees (department, school/college, university, and professional)

#### Positions
- Instructor (teach and serve)
- Lecturer (teach)
- Post-doc position (research, and maybe teach)
- Professor
  - Assistant (start)
  - Associate (get tenure)
  - Full (or get tenure here)
  - Distinguished/Chair/Endowed

#### Expectations of a Research University
1. Publish
  - Fund your research group & summer salary
  - Train/advise grad students
  - Get a reputation/make an impact: get invited to talks, gain visibility, engage in service (organizing conferences, be active in a professional organization or journal board)
  - Entrepreneurship: patents, software artifacts, strong GitHub, launch apps
  - Promotion/tenure in 6th year for good research (good teaching is also useful)
2. Teach 1-2 courses/semester, both undergrad & grad
  - You will have TAs to help you
3. Service
  - Department committee
  - University committee
  - Professional organization (program, funding, society, journal editor/chair/conference organizer) - but be selective as to which org


| Pros   | Cons                          |
|--------|-------------------------------|
|Freedom | Need to find your own funding |
|Work on the frontier | Must balance carefully (reseearch, teaching, service, & life) |
|Develop your vision | |
|Teach & inspire | |


#### Preparation While Getting your Ph.D.
- Research: read broadly - look out for future ideas
  - Publish
  - Network
  - Keep up communication skills
- TA as teaching prep
  - Ask for opportunities to lecture
- In general: ask!
  - Make your own opportunities. Ask to be nominated for awards, submit a paper, etc.

#### Following a Teaching Track at a Research University
Usually not tenured, but rather on contract
- 2-4 courses/semester
- Hold office hours
- Teach some non-majors
- Have undergrads help with your research
- Attend meetings
- Service
**Resources**: SIGCSE   
**Advantages**: closer with undergrads, less travel, more flexible for family
