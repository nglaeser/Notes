## Lecture 3

### ALU Design

We're going to create a MIPS ALU.
* Requirements
    * 32-bit
    * Implement 13 operations:
        * ADD, SUB, MULT, MULTU (multiply unsigned)
        * AND, OR, NOR, XOR
        * SLT, SLTU (set less than, set less than unsigned)
        * SLL, SRL, SRA (shift left logical, shift right logical, shift right arithmetic)
    * Inputs/outputs to ALU
        ```
        input [31:0] A, B
        input [3:0] op
        input [4:0] shamt // shift amount
        output [31:0] hi, lo // hi is 0, lo is output of operation
                             // except when multiplying, then hi is the top 32 bits and lo is bot 32 bits
        output zero
        ```
        * see slide 14
    * Code will be given (slides 19-23)
        * no opcode for nand (not recognized in MIPS assembler, it's a macro)
        * same for not, instead MIPS uses nor with $0
    * Concepts explained in slides 15-17

### Testbenches

Test functions and inputs.  
Types:
    * simple
    * self-checking
    * self-checking with testvectors
`#5` to pause 5 cycles, e.g., only works on simulator (before putting code on FPGA)

### Adders

"If you have more than one cycle per cycle, that's bad." - Charles  
**Ripple-carry adder**: usually to create an adder capable of adding numbers longer than 1 bit, you daisy-chain the carry-out and carry-ins. This is "slow" in the sense that it means you lower the maximum frequency of your chip.   
**Faster**: prefix adder, speculative, carry look-ahead adder

### Do project 2

## Lecture 4

Project 3 will deal with designing the regfile 32x32 (see slide 21).  
Write-bypassing is confusing.
