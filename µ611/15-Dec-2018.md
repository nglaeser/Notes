## Lecture 1

### Why HDL/FPGAs?

* Moore's Law is dead
* Replacing CPUs with GPUs or other specialized chips
* FPGAs are way slower (10-100x) than CPUs, but very parallelizable

### Field Programmablel Gate Arrays (FPGAs)

* 115,000 Logic Blocks, each several logic cells which consist of a look-up table (LUT) and flip-flop (FF)
* Logic blocks connected with switch matrix (like telephone hookups)
* IOB = I/O block
* CLB = clock logic block
* DCM = clock input?
* Embedded multiplier because common and faster to embed than simulate with LUTs
* logic elements (several per logic block) contain LUT

### FPGA Design Flow
1. Design system
    * Hardware description language (HDL)
        * VHDL
        * Verilog
    * schematics
2. Simulate using testbench
3. Synthesis: convert HDL to logic gates
4. Map: Convert larger gates to smaller ones that fit on hardware
5. Place: put each gate on slot in FPGA
6. Route: make connections between gates
7. Generate config file, program FPGA
8. Test on FPGA

Steps 5-6 take the most time. 3-7 in compilation.

## Lecture 2

### Verilog 
* Off-the-shelf components
    * "structural HDL"
* Combinational behavior (clock-independent)
    * F(inputs) = output
    ```
    assign a = b and c;

    // * denotes that sensitivity list contains all sensitivities
    // whenever an event in the sensitivity list occurs, execute the statement in the block
    // with *, it's essentially continuous
    always @(*) a = b and c; 
    ```
* Sequential behavior (clock-dependent)
    * F(inputs, input history) = output
    ```
    always @(posedge clk)
        a = up ? a + 8'b1 : a - 8'b1;
        /* C ternary operator:
           if up then a + 8'b1, else a- 8'b1
           8'b1 indicates 8-bit *b*inary value 1 */

    // multiple statements with begin and end
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        /* lots;
           of;
           lines;
           of;
           code; */
    end
    ```

* Syntax
    * case-sensitive
    * no names starting with numbers
    * ignores whitespace, underscores
    * Comments with `//` or `/* multiline */`
* Structural Modeling - Hierarchy
    ```
    module and3(input a, b, c, output y);
        assign y = a & b & c;
    endmodule

    module inv(input a, output y);
        assign y = ~a;
    endmodule

    module nand3(input a, b, c, output y);
        wire n1; # stateless, literal connection between two "ports"
        and3 andgate(a, b, c, n1); // create instance of and3 called andgate

        // preferred instantiation with specific argument setting
        and3 andgate(.y(n1), .b(b), .a(a), c(c));

        inv inverter(n1, y);
    endmodule
    ```
* Can define size of inputs and outputs
    ```
    module gates(input  [3:0]   a, b,
                 output [3:0]  y1, y2, y3, y4, y5);
        // definition...
    endmodule
    ```
* Operators
    * `&`: bitwise and
    * `|`: bitwise or
    * `^`: xor
    * `~`: not
    * etc. (see slide 15)
    * `{}`: concatenation of numbers/digits within braces
* `reg` is a stateful signal
* `wire` is stateless
* Blocking vs. Non-blocking Assignments
    * Non-blocking (`<=`)
        * occurs simultaneously with others (takes effect at end)
        * use with sequential behavior (clock-dependent)
        ```
        reg n1;
        always @(posedge clk);
            begin
                n1 <= d;
                q <= n1;
            end
        ```
    * Blocking (`=`)
        * occurs in order it appears in file
        * use with combinational behavior (clock-independent)
        ```
        reg n1;
        always @(posedge clk);
            begin
                n1 = d;
                q = n1;
            end
        ```
