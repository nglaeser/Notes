### Intro to Containers

#### Virtual Machines

- VM is a guest operating system on top of a host operating system (the host is a type 1 hypervisor)
- Whole OS though, so a lot of extra bloat if you just want to deploy single application
    - May be difficult to configure
    - Relatively slow
    - High resource footprint

#### Containers

- Contained environment to deploy applications without full VM bloat
- application will run the same regardless of OS because all the same dependencies will exist in the environment
- Relies heavily on host OS features, so it's quick to launch and takes up little space
- Made of multiple components
    - **Cgroups**: (Control groups, i.e. a collection of processes bound to a set resource limit) Limit amount of resources you have access to
    - **Namespaces**: (Isolated resource pools that are limited to what they have access to) LImit what you can access
    - **Copy-on-write storage**: (Type of storage where data is shared up until the point it is modified, Right before modification, data is copied to the location.) This is an efficient way of dealing with lots of data.

##### Cgroups
- Resource limiting (memory usage, file system cache)
- Prioiritization (shares of CPU utilization, disk I/O)
- Accounting (measure group utilization, log utilities)
- Control (freeze control groups, migrate, restart) 

#### Namespaces
- Partition kernel resources so processes each see different resource sets (i.e. docker container sees different root binaries than the native OS binaries)
- Various kinds
    - **mnt**: can define the root partition in a container, i.e. parent directory `/var/lib/docker/...../somefolder` maps to `/somefolder` in root directory on child container
    - **pid**: separate processes into their own process trees; child can't see parent's root process node
    - **net**: virtual network stack, with each namespace having its own interfaces, routing tables, firewalls, etc.
    - **UTS**: single system can have multiple host and domain names for different processes
    - **user**: isolate privileges and UIDs across processes

##### Copy-on-write storage

- Similar to `rsync`, only changes are actually copied into the mounted folder (from where it is mounted) and only upon modification
