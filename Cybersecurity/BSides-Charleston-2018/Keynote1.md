### Charting the Next Cybercrime Frontier, or Evolution of Criminal Intent

#### Deep & Dark Web: Brief Overview

1. Intrusion (knowledge/malware exchange, recruitment)
2. Data Markets (sell stolen data)
3. Shopping (black market of products and services)
4. Reshipment (move money between jurisdictions)

#### Malware

- Malware kits (2006-2010): the original kit by Slavik, called ZeuS
- Malware as a service (2011-Present): Zeus Peer-to-Peer group (aka Business Club), Bugat group (aka World Bank Center)
    - Cryptolocker by Business Club is the first real ransomware

#### Present
- Zeus Peer-to-Peer was taken down
- TrickBot botnet
    - Big data problem, backend now focused on indexing for easy access (not just storing)
    - High Value Targets (HVT) are hit with the most sophisticated attacks
